# Bank Account Management System

A simple command-line **Bank Account Management System** written in C++.  
This project allows users to create and manage bank accounts with core features like deposit, withdraw, and search — all via a console-based menu.

## 💡 Features

- Add new account with account number, name, and initial balance
- View all existing accounts
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Search by account number
- Input validation for clean user experience

---

## 🧪 How to Compile & Run

```bash

## 📌 Notes

- Console-based, no database
- All data in memory during runtime only
- Educational use for beginner C++ practice

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Modular design using functions
- Input validation with `cin.clear()` & `cin.ignore()`
- Managing arrays to simulate real-world banking
- Clean menu logic with `switch-case`
